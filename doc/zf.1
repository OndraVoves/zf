.SH NAME
zf -\ a commandline fuzzy finder that prioritizes matches on filenames

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zf [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zf is a simple, general-purpose fuzzy finder that prioritizes matches on
filenames.

zf reads a list of newline separated strings on stdin and displays an
interactive interface. Pressing enter outputs the selected line on stdout. Text
may be entered to filter the list of strings.

Each whitespace-separated term in the query string is used separately to narrow
down the search results. For example, searching for "init config" will select
all results that match both "init" and "config". Note that the query is restricted
to a maximum of 16 whitespace-separated tokens.

Matching is case insensitive unless an uppercase letter is found in the query.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-filter
Skip interactive use and filter using the given query

.TP
.BR \-k ", " \-\-keep\-order
Don't sort by rank and preserve order of lines read on stdin. This makes zf remove
any lines that don't match, but the order of lines will not change.

.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-lines
Set the maximum number of result lines to show. Defaults to 10. Will be clamped
to the number of candidates or the height of the terminal, whichever is
greater. Set to a large number (like 1000) to display zf full screen.

.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-plain
Disable filename match prioritization. Useful when the input lines are not
filenames.
